# wheelock-perl

Usage: `wheelock-perl --period breakfast/lunch/etc --date DD-MM-YYYY`

Program to get the current menu of Acadia University's dining hall Wheelock hall using Perl with the Dine on Campus API.

## TODO:

- Filter specific categories

## ⚠️ NOTE ⚠️

As I'm writing this, the Wheelock Hall menu is not open. I'm writing a lot of this program without being able to test it with an actual menu so it most likely won't be fully working until Wheelock opens again.
