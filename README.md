# wheelock-perl

Program to get the current menu of Acadia University's dining hall Wheelock hall using Perl with the Dine on Campus API.

## TODO:

- Show all the different periods
- Choose another date to show

## ⚠️ NOTE ⚠️

As I'm writing this, the Wheelock Hall menu is not open. I'm writing a lot of this program without being able to test it with a menu so it most likely won't be finished until Wheelock opens again.

Working:
- Get school id
- Get location id
- Get API JSON data
Untested:
- Getting and printing categories from the menu
