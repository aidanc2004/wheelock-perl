# wheelock-perl

Program to get the current menu of Acadia University's dining hall Wheelock hall using Perl with the Dine on Campus API.

## ⚠️ NOTE ⚠️

As I'm writing this, the Wheelock Hall menu is not open. I'm writing a lot of this program without being able to test it with an actual menu so it most likely won't be fully working until Wheelock opens again.

"test-data.json" is a mock data set that's interpreted from my Swift/SwiftUI Wheelock Hall app for Mac OS and iOS.
